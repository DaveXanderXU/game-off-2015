Escape from Efriador V
========================

[game-off-2015](https://github.com/blog/1972-the-game-has-changed) challenge entry.

This is a fork of Ogoshen's [Octojump](https://github.com/ogoshen/game-off-2012) game. 
I already have a [game-off-2012](https://github.com/petarov/game-off-2012) repository and I could not fork his repo directly.

About
-----
A Doodle Jump clone for the **Github Game Off 2012**.

Use the arrow keys to navigate your ever-jumping Octocat and collect stars for extra points.
Push higher with the green platforms, watch out from the red, they'll be pulled from under you.
Forks will teleport you around 100 lines of code further.


Technicals
----------
Best playable on Chrome, works in FF (less FPS), fails on IE9 (getter\setters) and untested on others...
I've used the Octicons font instead of sprites for the pickups, saves bandwidth and scales better,
at the prices of more CSS3 effects.
Overall, not a lot of canvas is used, which means less performance, as the DOM gets updated often.
