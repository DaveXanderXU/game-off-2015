_.o0 Strider 0o._
===============================

:video_game: [game-off-2015](https://github.com/blog/1972-the-game-has-changed) challenge entry.

The year is 2415. You are _Strider_. An agent of the rebel forces of Atira and Taristol II. Your mission is to infiltrate the government science facility on the moon *Efriador V* and extract all the information available about the development of a new war unit called the *Spitflyer*. You have successfully collected the data required and you now need to head to the extraction point at the top most level of the facility. A transport will be waiting for you to take you to safety. 

Good luck!

## Fork Info

This is a fork of Ogoshen's [Octojump](https://github.com/ogoshen/game-off-2012) game. It's not a fork of the repo itself, because I already have a [game-off-2012](https://github.com/petarov/game-off-2012) repository and Github does not allow one to have two repos with the same name.

## Controls

Make your way to the top by using:

  * :running: `Arrow keys` or `WAsD` keys to move and jump on platforms. 
  * :arrow_up: Press `Up Arrow` or `W` twice to double jump.
  * :gun: `X`, `Z` or `Y` - To shoot at the nearest enemy. Your *RP-2300 "Warmonger"* assault rifle is fully automatic. Just aim it at your target and it will do the rest. Your energy replenishes with 1 every 1.5 seconds.
  * :rage1: Press `1` to use overcharge. Trade 1 health for complete energy refill.

It might seem like a hard to play game at the beginning, but it's really not. A couple of hints:

 * Move, move, move. Don't just stay at one place when the enemy shoots at you. Always *move*, *jump* and track the enemy projectiles.
 * Save your health and energy powerups for later use. You may always go back down to pick up a powerup left behind.
