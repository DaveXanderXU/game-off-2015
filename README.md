.o0 Strider 0o.
===============================

[game-off-2015](https://github.com/blog/1972-the-game-has-changed) challenge entry.

This is a fork of Ogoshen's [Octojump](https://github.com/ogoshen/game-off-2012) game. It is not a fork of the repo itself, because
I already had a [game-off-2012](https://github.com/petarov/game-off-2012) repository and Github does not allow one to have two repositories with the same name.

## Story

The year is 2415. You are _Strider_. A a member of the rebel forces of Atira and Taristol II. Your mission is to infiltrate the government science facility on the moon *Efriador V* and extract all the information available about the development of a new war unit called the *Spitflyer*. As soon as you collect your data you need to head to the extraction point at the top most level of the facility. A transport will be waiting for you to take you to safety. 

Good luck!

## Controls

Make your way to the top by using:

  * Arrow keys or `WASD` keys to move and jump on platforms.
  * `X`, `Z` or `Y - Shoot at the nearest enemy. Your TR-15 is fully automatic. Just point to the enemy and it will do the aiming for you.
